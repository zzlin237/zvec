  //! Allocate a large, page-aligned block that prefers transparent huge pages.
  //!
  //! On Linux the block is obtained via anonymous mmap and hinted with
  //! MADV_HUGEPAGE; on other platforms it falls back to a page-aligned
  //! allocation without the huge-page hint (which is a performance hint, not a
  //! correctness requirement).  Returns nullptr on failure.
  //!
  //! `size` is rounded up to the huge page size internally, and the same
  //! rounded value is what the corresponding FreeHugePage call expects, so
  //! callers should treat the returned block as exactly AlignHugePageSize(size)
  //! bytes.
  //!
  //! `zero_fill` requests zeroed memory: when true the returned block is
  //! guaranteed to be zero-initialized. When false the caller does not require
  //! zeroing, but the implementation is still free to return zeroed memory and
  //! does so on the anonymous-mmap path (MAP_ANONYMOUS pages are always zero),
  //! where an explicit memset is skipped to preserve lazy paging. In other
  //! words, true => always zeroed; false => zeroing is not guaranteed either
  //! way. Never assume non-zero contents.
  //!
  //! Blocks returned here MUST be released with FreeHugePage (never free()),
  //! because the underlying allocator differs per platform.

  //!
  //! When `size` is at least the huge page size, the block is obtained via
  //! AllocateHugePage (huge-page-backed, page-aligned). Otherwise a regular
  //! `alignment`-aligned allocation is used, which avoids wasting a full huge
  //! page on small buffers. Returns nullptr on failure.
  //!
  //! `alignment` must be a power of two.
  //!
  //! `zero_fill` follows the same contract as AllocateHugePage: true guarantees
  //! zeroed memory; false does not require zeroing but the implementation may
  //! still return zeroed memory (it does on the huge-page mmap path). Never
  //! assume non-zero contents.
  //!
  //! Blocks returned here MUST be released with FreeAligned, passing the same
  //! `size`, because the chosen allocator (and therefore the matching free) is
  //! derived from `size`.
